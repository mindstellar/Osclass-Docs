# Install

## **Step 1**

Download and unzip the Osclass package.

## **Step 2**

Move the Osclass unzipped files to the desired location on your server.

## **Step 3**

Execute the Osclass installation script by accessing index.php or oc-includes/osclass/install.php from your browser:

* If you’ve installed it in the domain’s root directory, you’ll have to go to: [http://example.com/index.php](http://example.com/index.php) or directly to [http://example.com/oc-includes/osclass/install.php](http://example.com/oc-includes/osclass/install.php)
* If you’ve installed it in a subdirectory inside the domain, classifieds, for example, go to: [http://example.com/classifieds/index.php](http://example.com/classifieds/index.php) or directly to [http://example.com/classifieds/oc-includes/osclass/install.php](http://example.com/classifieds/oc-includes/osclass/install.php)

## **Step 4**

Follow the installer’s instructions:

* Step 4.1
  * Make sure the server has the required permissions to write in the files and directories specified. This will allow you to create a basic configuration file as well as upload images, documents, etc.
* Step 4.2
  * Add your access details to the database. If you haven’t created it yet, the installer will ask for another account with permissions that will allow to do it for you.
* Step 4.3
  * Add the basic installation details and select your classifieds site’s country.
* Step 4.4
  * Your installation is finished! Use the automatically-generated password to access your admin panel \(/oc-admin\).
