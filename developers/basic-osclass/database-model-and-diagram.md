* Download [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) (it's free and cross-platform!)
* Install it and open it
* Select **Create EER Model From SQL Script**
* Look for your file 'struct.sql (your\_osclass\_folder/oc-includes/osclass/installer/struct.sql)
* **Check** Place imported object on a diagram
* Click on **Execute**, **Next**, **Finish**
* Re-arrange the boxes (tables) as you wish

Relations will highlight if you place your mouse over the tables or the relations.
