# Database model and diagram

This diagram could be a bit difficult to understand at first and follow all the relations. To be able to use an interactive version of the same diagram, please use the [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and follow these steps.

* Download [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) \(it's free and cross-platform!\)
* Install it and open it
* Select **Create EER Model From SQL Script**
* Look for your file 'struct.sql \(your\_osclass\_folder/oc-includes/osclass/installer/struct.sql\)
* **Check** Place imported object on a diagram
* Click on **Execute**, **Next**, **Finish**
* Re-arrange the boxes \(tables\) as you wish

Relations will highlight if you place your mouse over the tables or the relations.
